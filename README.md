#3D-Box Simulator

This was a little demo project I did to explore the features supported with JavaFX 3D. This requires a modern graphics card in order to be viewed properly.

You are basically enclosed in this 3D box with a rotating crystal in the middle.

##Keys
* Use WASD to move around the box room
* Use E to raise angle of elevation 
* Use Q to lower angle of elevation
